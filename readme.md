<div id="q1"></div>

## 1. What is Javascript ? [&uarr; Top](#top)
JavaScript is a high-level, <b>interpreted programming</b>  language that is widely used for building dynamic web pages and applications. It was created in 1995 by <b>Brendan Eich</b>, then an employee of Netscape Communications Corporation, and it has since become one of the most popular programming languages in the world.

JavaScript is often used in conjunction with HTML and CSS to create interactive web pages and web applications. It runs on the client-side of the web, meaning it executes in the user's browser, as well as on the server-side using platforms such as Node.js.

JavaScript is a versatile language that supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, functional, and procedural programming. It also has a vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks, such as React, Vue, Angular, and jQuery, which make it easier to develop complex web applications

<div id="q2"></div>

## 2. What is Key Features of Javascript ? [&uarr; Top](#top)
- **Dynamic Typing:** JavaScript is a dynamically-typed language, which means that variable types are determined at runtime rather than being declared explicitly in the code.

- **First-class Functions:** Functions in JavaScript are treated as first-class citizens, which means they can be passed around as arguments to other functions, returned as values from functions, and stored in variables.

- **Closures:** Closures are a powerful feature of JavaScript that allow functions to access variables from an outer function that has already returned. This makes it possible to create private variables and methods within a function.

- **Prototypal Inheritance:** JavaScript uses prototypal inheritance, which allows objects to inherit properties and methods from their parent objects. This makes it possible to create complex object hierarchies and reuse code in a more efficient way.

- **Event-driven programming:** JavaScript is often used for event-driven programming, where code is executed in response to events such as user input, page loads, or timer events.

- **Asynchronous Programming:** JavaScript has built-in support for asynchronous programming, which means that code can execute in a non-blocking way. This is particularly useful for tasks such as fetching data from a server or performing complex calculations that might otherwise freeze the user interface.

- **DOM Manipulation:** JavaScript is widely used for manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM) in web pages, which allows developers to create dynamic and interactive user interfaces.

<div id="q3"></div>

## 3. What are the data types in JavaScript ? [&uarr; Top](#top)
JavaScript supports several data types, including numbers, strings, booleans, null, undefined, objects, and symbols.

<div id="q4"></div>

## 4. What is the difference between null and undefined in JavaScript ? [&uarr; Top](#top)
null represents the intentional absence of any object value, while undefined represents the absence of a defined value.

<div id="q5"></div>

## 5. What is NaN in JavaScript? [&uarr; Top](#top)
NaN stands for "Not a Number," and it is a value that is returned when a mathematical operation that cannot be performed is attempted.

<div id="q6"></div>

## 6. What is the difference between Primitive and Non-primitive data types in JavaScript? [&uarr; Top](#top)
The main difference between primitive and non-primitive data types in JavaScript is that primitive data types store a single value like let, string, boolean, undefined and null while non-primitive data types can store multiple values and methods like object, date, RegExp and function. Additionally, primitive data types are immutable, while non-primitive data types are mutable

<div id="q7"></div>

## 7. What is the difference between == and === in JavaScript? [&uarr; Top](#top)
The double equals (==) operator checks for equality after converting both values to a common type. The triple equals (===) operator checks for equality without performing any type conversions.

<div id="q8"></div>

## 8. What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous code in JavaScript?  [&uarr; Top](#top)
Synchronous code is executed in a sequential manner, where each line of code must finish executing before the next line is executed. Asynchronous code, on the other hand, allows multiple things to happen at the same time.

<div id="q9"></div>

## 9. What is the difference between let ,var and const in JavaScript?[&uarr; Top](#top)
**var**: The 'var' keyword was the only way to declare a variable prior to the release of ES6 (ECMAScript 2015). It declares a variable globally or locally to an entire function regardless of block scope. However, 'var' does not support block-scoping, which means that a variable declared with 'var' inside a block will be visible outside that block. Also, a variable declared with 'var' can be re-declared and updated.

**let:** The 'let' keyword is used to declare block-scoped variables. A variable declared with 'let' is only accessible within the block scope it was declared in, including any nested blocks. Also, 'let' variables can be updated but not re-declared.

**const:** The 'const' keyword is used to declare variables that cannot be reassigned a new value. Variables declared with 'const' are also block-scoped.

<div id="q10"></div>

## 10. What is the difference between null and undefined in JavaScript?[&uarr; Top](#top)
**undefined** is a primitive data type that is automatically assigned to a variable that has been declared but not yet assigned a value. It is also the default return value of a function that does not return a value. For example:
```
let x;
console.log(x); // Output: undefined

function foo() {}
console.log(foo()); // Output: undefined

```
On the other hand, **null** is a value that represents the intentional absence of any object value. It is often used to indicate that a variable has no value, or that a function should return no value. For example:
```
let y = null;
console.log(y); // Output: null

function bar() {
  return null;
}
console.log(bar()); // Output: null

```

<div id="q11"></div>

## 11. What is first class function?[&uarr; Top](#top)
In JavaScript, functions are considered first-class citizens, which means that they can be treated like any other value. This includes being assigned to variables, passed as arguments to other functions, and returned as values from functions. A function that can be assigned to a variable, passed as an argument, or returned from a function is called a first-class function.

Here is an example of a first-class function in JavaScript:
```
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

const result = add(2, 3); // result is 5

const sum = add; // assigning the function to a variable

const newResult = sum(4, 5); // newResult is 9

```


<div id="q12"></div>

## 12. What is higher order function? [&uarr; Top](#top)
In JavaScript, a higher-order function is a function that takes one or more functions as arguments, and/or returns a function as its result. Higher-order functions are a powerful feature of the language, as they enable functional programming paradigms and allow for code that is more modular, reusable, and expressive.

Here is an example of a higher-order function in JavaScript:
```
function multiplyBy(factor) {
  return function(number) {
    return number * factor;
  }
}

const double = multiplyBy(2);
const triple = multiplyBy(3);

console.log(double(5)); // 10
console.log(triple(5)); // 15

```

<div id="q13"></div>

## 13. What is first order function? [&uarr; Top](#top)
In JavaScript, a first-order function is a function that doesn't take any functions as arguments and doesn't return a function as its result. In other words, a first-order function is a simple function that takes only primitive data types (like strings, numbers, and booleans) as arguments and returns a value of a primitive data type.

Here's an example of a first-order function in JavaScript:
```
function addNumbers(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

```

<div id="q14"></div>

## 14. What is the difference between parameter and argument in JavaScript?
A **parameter** is a named variable in a function definition that receives a value when the function is called. Parameters are used to define the inputs that a function expects to receive. For example, in the following function definition, "x" and "y" are parameters:
```
function add(x, y) {
  return x + y;
}

```
An **argument** is a value that is passed to a function when it is called. Arguments are used to supply the inputs that a function expects to receive. For example, in the following function call, "2" and "3" are arguments:
```
add(2, 3);

```

<div id="q15"></div>

## 15. What is Callback?[&uarr; Top](#top)
A callback is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed when that function has completed its operation.

Callbacks are commonly used in asynchronous programming, where a function does not block the execution of the program but instead returns immediately, allowing other code to be executed while it waits for a response. When the response is received, the callback function is called to handle the data

<div id="q16"></div>

## 16.Why we need a callback in javascript? [&uarr; Top](#top)
Callbacks are a fundamental concept in JavaScript, and they are used extensively in asynchronous programming. Here are a few reasons why callbacks are important in JavaScript:

**Handling Asynchronous Operations:** JavaScript is often used for programming applications that rely on asynchronous operations, such as network communication, file input/output, and user interface events. Using callbacks allows us to write code that can execute non-blocking operations and still be notified when those operations complete.

**Passing Functions as Arguments:** JavaScript allows functions to be passed as arguments to other functions, which means that we can create more flexible and reusable code by passing different functions as callbacks depending on the situation.

**Event Handling:** JavaScript can be used to handle user interface events, such as button clicks, mouse movements, and keyboard input. Callbacks are often used to handle these events, allowing the application to respond to user input in real-time.

**Control Flow:** Callbacks can be used to control the flow of execution in a program, allowing us to create complex sequences of operations that execute in a specific order.

<div id="q17"></div>

## 17. What is difference conformation box and alert box? [&uarr; Top](#top)
A confirmation box, also known as a confirm box, is used to ask the user for confirmation before proceeding with an action. It typically displays a message and two buttons, usually labeled "OK" and "Cancel". When the user clicks "OK", the confirm box returns a value of true, while clicking "Cancel" returns a value of false. Here's an example:
```
if (confirm("Are you sure you want to delete this item?")) {
  // Delete the item
} else {
  // Do nothing
}

```
An alert box, on the other hand, is used to display a message to the user. It typically has only one button, labeled "OK". When the user clicks "OK", the alert box is dismissed. Here's an example:
```
alert("Your message has been sent!");

```

<div id="q18"></div>

## 18. What is the difference between shift and unshift in JavaScript? [&uarr; Top](#top)
**shift()** method removes the first element from an array and returns it. This means that the array is modified and its length is reduced by one.
Here's an example:
```
const arr = [1, 2, 3];
const firstElement = arr.shift(); // firstElement = 1, arr = [2, 3]

```
**unshift()** method adds one or more elements to the beginning of an array and returns the new length of the array. This means that the original array is modified and new elements are added to the beginning of the array.
```
const arr = [2, 3];
const newLength = arr.unshift(1); // newLength = 3, arr = [1, 2, 3]

```

<div id="q19"></div>

## 19. What is the difference between slice and splice in JavaScript? [&uarr; Top](#top)

**slice()** method returns a new array that contains a copy of a portion of the original array. The original array is not modified.
Here's an example:
```
const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const sliced = arr.slice(1, 4); // sliced = [2, 3, 4], arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

```
**The slice()** method takes two arguments: start and end, which are optional. If start is not specified, the slice starts from the beginning of the array. If end is not specified, the slice ends at the end of the array.

splice() method changes the contents of an array by removing or replacing existing elements and/or adding new elements. This means that the original array is modified.
Here's an example:
```
const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const spliced = arr.splice(2, 2, 6, 7); // spliced = [3, 4], arr = [1, 2, 6, 7, 5]

```

<div id="q20"></div>

## 20. What is the difference between rest and spread in JavaScript? [&uarr; Top](#top)
In JavaScript, both rest and spread are features of the ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) specification that enable more flexible handling of arrays and objects.

**Rest** is used to represent an indefinite number of arguments as an array. It is denoted by an ellipsis ... before the name of a parameter in a function definition, indicating that any number of additional arguments can be passed in as an array.
Here's an example:
```
function sum(...numbers) {
  return numbers.reduce((total, number) => total + number);
}

sum(1, 2, 3, 4); // returns 10

```
**Spread** is used to spread the elements of an array or an object into another array or object. It is also denoted by an ellipsis ..., but in this case it is used before an array or an object to spread its elements.
```
const arr1 = [1, 2, 3];
const arr2 = [4, 5, 6];
const mergedArray = [...arr1, ...arr2]; // mergedArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

```


<div id="q21"></div>

## 21. What is the difference between deep copy and shalow copy in JavaScript? [&uarr; Top](#top)
In JavaScript, when you create a copy of an object or an array, there are two ways to do it: deep copy and shallow copy.

**Shallow copy** creates a new object or array, but its properties or elements still point to the same memory location as the original object or array. This means that changes made to the original object or array will also affect the copied object or array.
Here's an example:
```
const original = {a: {b: 1}};
const copied = Object.assign({}, original);

original.a.b = 2;

console.log(original.a.b); // outputs 2
console.log(copied.a.b); // outputs 2 as well, because the objects are sharing the same reference

```
In the above example, copied is a shallow copy of original, so changes made to the original object also affect the copied object.

**Deep copy** creates a new object or array and also copies all nested objects or arrays, so that the copied object or array is completely independent from the original object or array.
Here's an example:
```
const original = {a: {b: 1}};
const copied = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(original));

original.a.b = 2;

console.log(original.a.b); // outputs 2
console.log(copied.a.b); // outputs 1, because the objects are completely independent

```
In the above example, copied is a deep copy of original, so changes made to the original object do not affect the copied object.

So, the main difference between deep copy and shallow copy is that deep copy creates a completely independent copy of the original object or array, while shallow copy only creates a new object or array that shares some of the properties or elements with the original object or array.

<div id="q22"></div>

## 22. What is the difference between call, apply and bind in JavaScript? [&uarr; Top](#top)
In JavaScript, call, apply, and bind are methods that allow you to set the this value for a function and pass in arguments in different ways.

call and apply are used to call a function immediately, while bind returns a new function with the this value and some arguments pre-set.
Here are the differences between them:

**call:**
The call() method allows you to call a function with a given this value and arguments provided as a list (comma-separated). Here's an example:
```
const person = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
  greet: function() {
    console.log(`Hi, my name is ${this.name} and I am ${this.age} years old.`);
  }
};

const employee = {
  name: "Jane",
  age: 25
};

person.greet.call(employee); // outputs "Hi, my name is Jane and I am 25 years old."

```
In the above example, call() is used to call the greet() function with the employee object as the this value.

**apply:**
The apply() method is similar to call(), but the arguments are passed in as an array. Here's an example:
```
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

const sum = function() {
  return Array.prototype.reduce.call(arguments, (total, number) => total + number);
};

const result = sum.apply(null, numbers);

console.log(result); // outputs 15

```
In the above example, apply() is used to call the sum() function with the numbers array as the argument list.

**bind:**
The bind() method returns a new function with the this value and some arguments pre-set. Here's an example:
```
const person = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
  greet: function(greeting) {
    console.log(`${greeting}, my name is ${this.name} and I am ${this.age} years old.`);
  }
};

const employee = {
  name: "Jane",
  age: 25
};

const greetEmployee = person.greet.bind(employee, "Hello");

greetEmployee(); // outputs "Hello, my name is Jane and I am 25 years old."

```
In the above example, bind() is used to create a new function greetEmployee with the employee object as the this value and "Hello" as the first argument.

So, the main difference between call(), apply(), and bind() is the way they pass arguments to the function and the way they set the this value.

## 23. What is local storage in JavaScript? [&uarr; Top](#top)
Local storage is a type of storage in JavaScript that allows web developers to store data within a user's browser. It is a key-value store, meaning that data is stored as a pair of key and value. Local storage data persists even after the user closes the browser window


<div id="q24"></div>

## 24. What is session storage in JavaScript? [&uarr; Top](#top)
Session storage is another type of storage in JavaScript that allows web developers to store data within a user's browser. Unlike local storage, session storage data is stored only for the duration of the user's browser session, meaning that the data is lost when the user closes the browser window


<div id="q25"></div>

## 25. What is the difference between local storage and session storage? [&uarr; Top](#top)
The main difference between local storage and session storage is that local storage data persists even after the user closes the browser window, while session storage data is lost when the user closes the browser window

<div id="q26"></div>

## 26. How do you store data in local storage in JavaScript? [&uarr; Top](#top)
To store data in local storage, you can use the localStorage.setItem() method. For example, localStorage.setItem('key', 'value'); will store the string 'value' under the key 'key' in local storage

<div id="q27"></div>

## 27. How do you retrieve data from local storage in JavaScript?
To retrieve data from local storage, you can use the localStorage.getItem() method. For example, localStorage.getItem('key'); will return the value stored under the key 'key' in local storage

<div id="q28"></div>

## 28. How do you remove data from local storage in JavaScript? [&uarr; Top](#top)
To remove data from local storage, you can use the localStorage.removeItem() method. For example, localStorage.removeItem('key'); will remove the key-value pair with the key 'key' from local storage.

<div id="q29"></div>

## 29. How do you clear all data from local storage in JavaScript? [&uarr; Top](#top)
To clear all data from local storage, you can use the localStorage.clear() method. For example, localStorage.clear(); will remove all key-value pairs from local storage

<div id="q30"></div>

## 30. What is the maximum amount of data that can be stored in local storage? [&uarr; Top](#top)
The maximum amount of data that can be stored in local storage is typically around 5-10 MB, depending on the browser and device

<div id="q31"></div>

## 31. How do you check if local storage is available in JavaScript? [&uarr; Top](#top)
Answer: To check if local storage is available, you can use the localStorage object. For example, if (typeof localStorage !== 'undefined') { /* local storage is available */ } will check if the localStorage object is defined.

<div id="q32"></div>

## 32. Is local storage secure in JavaScript? [&uarr; Top](#top)
Local storage is not very secure in JavaScript, as the data can be accessed by any script running on the same domain. It is important to be careful when storing sensitive data in local storage and to encrypt the data if necessary

<div id="q33"></div>

## 33. What is the difference between cookies and local storage? [&uarr; Top](#top)
Cookies are small text files that are stored on a user's device by a website, while local storage is a type of storage in JavaScript that allows web developers to store data directly in a user's browser. Cookies are typically used for authentication and tracking, while local storage is used for storing user-specific data such as preferences and settings.

<div id="q34"></div>

## 34. How can you ensure that local storage data is not lost if the user clears their browser cache? [&uarr; Top](#top)
Local storage data is typically not cleared when a user clears their browser cache, but it may be cleared if the user clears their browser data or if the storage quota is exceeded. To ensure that local storage data is not lost, you can periodically backup the data to a server or use other storage options such as cookies or indexedDB

<div id="q35"></div>

## 35. How do you set an expiration date for local storage data in JavaScript? [&uarr; Top](#top)
There is no built-in way to set an expiration date for local storage data in JavaScript, but you can manually check the age of the data and delete it if it is too old. Alternatively, you can use a third-party library or framework that provides this functionality


<div id="q36"></div>

## 36. What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous storage operations in JavaScript? [&uarr; Top](#top)
Synchronous storage operations in JavaScript block the main thread of the browser until the operation is complete, while asynchronous storage operations allow other code to continue running while the operation is being performed. Asynchronous storage operations are generally preferred because they provide a better user experience and prevent the browser from freezing or becoming unresponsive


<div id="q37"></div>

## 37. How do you handle errors when working with local storage in JavaScript? [&uarr; Top](#top)
When working with local storage in JavaScript, you should always check for errors and handle them appropriately. Common errors include exceeding the storage quota, invalid data types, and security violations. You can use try-catch blocks or error handling functions to catch and handle these errors.

<div id="q38"></div>

## 38. How do you synchronize local storage data between multiple devices? [&uarr; Top](#top)
Synchronizing local storage data between multiple devices can be challenging, as local storage data is specific to a single browser on a single device. To synchronize data between devices, you can use a server-side database or cloud storage service, or you can use a third-party library or framework that provides synchronization functionality

<div id="q39"></div>

## 39. What is browser caching and how does it work?  [&uarr; Top](#top)
Browser caching is a process by which a browser stores a copy of a webpage or other web content on the user's device so that it can be quickly retrieved and displayed the next time the user visits the same page. When a user requests a page for the first time, the browser downloads all of the necessary resources (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.) and stores them in its cache. The next time the user visits the same page, the browser checks its cache first and retrieves the resources from there if they have not expired or been modified
